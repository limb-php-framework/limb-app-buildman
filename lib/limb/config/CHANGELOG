==================================================

-- lmbCachedIni uses serialize(..) instead of var_export(..) for cached data. This method is much faster.
-- lmbConf now supports files overriding, i.e "foo.conf.php" is overridden with "foo.conf.override.php"
-- $conf in lmbConf is filled with empty array by default
-- lmbConfTools added(moved from lmbWebAppTools)
-- lmbConfTools :: setTestingIni(..), :: clearTestingIni(..) added (tests/common.inc.php will be removed soon)
-- tests are more isolated
