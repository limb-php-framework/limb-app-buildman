0.2.0 - 16 February 2007 r:5072
==================================================

-- some minor improvements in <core:wrap> tag that now allows to produce better error messages.
-- added basic support for checkbox groups (adding checked attribute available with array data for now).
-- proper work of "from" attribute for WactRuntimeDatasourceComponentTag and WactRuntimeDatasourceComponentHTMLTag like <core:datasource> and <form runat='server'>. Please note: initial data container for DBE in "from" attribute is parent tag not the tag itself. Eg.: <core:datasource from='data'> takes "data" from parent (not <core:datasource from='^data'>).
-- <select> tag now can parse its child <option> tags and use it as default options list. You can  use <option value='some_value' selected> to set default selection as well.
-- refactoring: WactComponentParsingState :: findComponent() renamed to WactComponentParsingState :: findTagInfo;
-- WACT_PARSER_FORBID_PARSING constant restored that allows tags to forbid parsing their contents if needed.
-- <list:serapator> tag now supports "literal" attribute that allows to restrict parsing tag contents.
-- fixed /tests/run.php script. Now it works in CLI mode only.
-- new <core:repeat> tag that allows to repeat a portion of template several times
-- "text" filter renamed to "nl2br"
-- better "trim" filter functionality
-- new <form:preserve_state name='attr_name'> tag that calls WactFormComponent->preserveState() and causes to generate hidden input with "attr_name" attribute as name and value taken from WactFormComponent datasource.
-- refactored version of pager tags. Now pager allows to use both sections and elipses (as old WACT pager).
-- ListRowNumber property now cares about <list:list> dataset offset.
-- <list:separator> now supports "step" attribute that allows to output separator contents every "step" rows only.
-- WactArrayObject :: getOffset() added (mostly to support new functionality of ListRowNumber)
-- new "constant" filter. That allows to replace constant name with its value.
-- new "safejstext" filter that resplaces all "\r\n" with "<br/>" unlike "nl2br" that just added "<br/>" near "\r\n"
-- new <form:errors> tag that allows to pass form validations errors list to any <list:list> tag.
-- new <form_multiple> tag that allows to have several forms on the same page and every form field will be prefixed with form name so request processing can be more simple.
-- new <js_checkbox> tag that generates checkbox with hidden input. This checkbox always sends it's value (0 or 1) regardless of checked flag.
-- new <form:referer> tag that generated a hidden input tag with referer information taken from $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] or $_GET['referer'] or $_POST['referer'].
-- new <select:options_source> tag that allows to convert different types of datasources into options list for <select> tag.
-- new <select_with_grouped_options> tag to generate <select> with grouped options list. Choice list must be set from php-script.
-- many examples from old WACT restored. New ones added.
-- WactArrayIterator :: paginate($offset, $limit) method added. WactArrayIterator now supports pagination.
-- fixed a bug with <core:set> tag. Now it uses nearest parest datasource component instead of immediate parent component that could not be a datasource at all.
-- <core:set> tag now supports "runtime" attribute. If this attribute presents the tag will generate DBE only and will skip registering constant property in parent datasource tag.
-- WactFilterDictionary, WactTagDictionary, WactPropertyDictionary allow to register element info once only.
-- added WACT prefixes for all non-prefixes classes in WACT packages (including FSM and Math_Rpn)
-- now tag compiler properties are registered for tag class not just tag name. This allows to keep propety compatibility with tags that are inherit from core WACT tags.
-- experimental version of optimized Wact compiler that generates much less code in compiled template. This allows to gain some performance improvements in complext templates. Compiled templates code now looks much cleaner too.
-- WactRuntimeComponent :: getDataSource() and getDatasourceComponent() methods added
-- some minor speed improvements in WactArrayObject
