======================== BUILDMAN - simple PHP Continuous Integration Server ========================

1) Unpack the archive, for example in directory /var/www/buildman

2) Make /var/www/buildman/var directory writable for web server:

$ chmod 777 /var/www/buildman/var

3) Create BUILDMAN VirtualHost in Apache config file(httpd.conf), something like this:

<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/buildman/www/
    ServerName buildman
    ErrorLog logs/buildman-error_log
    CustomLog logs/buildman-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

4) Put "buildman" host name into /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1  buildman

5) Restart Apache

6) Open http://buildman in your browser, you should see a couple of test projects

7) All projects settings are stored in "projects" directory of buildman application. You can copy "projects-examples" 
  directory into "projects" directory in order to try some sample projects.

8) Try starting continuous integration process for all projects by invoking the following command in shell:

$ php /var/www/buildman/bin/build.php
